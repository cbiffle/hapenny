class EWBox(Component):
    """The EW-Box does execute and writeback -- basically all of the CPU logic
    except for fetch and sequencing.

    States:

    State 0: use rs1 value read by FD-Box, latch it into accumulator, start rs2
        read.
    State 1: operate on accumulator and rs2/immediate, write rd if appropriate.
        Instructions generally end here.
    State 2: depends.
    - Loads: write to rd
    - Bxx: perform branch target computation
    - SLT: rewrite rd to set flag
    - Shifts: shift one more bit and hold this state until done; write rd.

    Parameters
    ----------
    reset_vector (int): address where the CPU will begin fetching instructions
        after reset. Default 0 if not provided.
    addr_width (int): number of low-order bits that are significant in memory
        addresses. The default is 32; if this is reduced, memory and I/O
        devices will appear to repeat at higher addresses because the top bits
        won't be decoded. Note that this parameter is in terms of byte
        addresses (the numbers RV32I software deals with); the actual bus port
        has addr_width-2 address lines because it addresses words.
    prog_addr_width (int): number of low-order bits that are significant in
        instruction addresses. This determines the width of the PC register(s)
        and fetch path. If program storage is in the lower section of the
        address range, and I/O devices higher, you can set this parameter to
        smaller than addr_width to save some area. If not explicitly
        overridden, this is the same as addr_width.  addr_width.

    Attributes
    ----------
    onehot_state (input): state input from the S-Box
    inst_next (input): instruction word from FD.

    rf_read_cmd (output): read command to the register file, intended to be OR'd.
    rf_resp (input): value most recently read from the register file.

    bus (port): our connection to the memory fabric.

    pc_next (output): PC to FD for fetch of next instruction. We need to provide
        a useful next-PC value here by the end of state 0 to get a useful fetch
        done. We then need to hold that value through subsequent states. If we
        violate this, we need to generate a bubble.
    from_the_top (output): signals S-Box to rewind state when asserted.
    rf_write_cmd (port): output to register file to write registers.
    full (output): indicates whether we're doing useful work. When we have a
        real instruction from FD, and we're honoring it (i.e. it is not a
        speculative fetch that became irrelevant due to a change in control
        flow), we set this. It is clear at reset to create an initial pipeline
        bubble until the first fetch completes, and we clear it on instruction
        stream changes.
    pc (output): Current contents of PC register, mostly for debug port.
    debug_pc_write (port): while halted, can overwrite the PC with a word
        address (bottom two bits implied as zero).
    hold (output): Indicates that we're going to repeat this state, signals
        s-box to maintain it.
